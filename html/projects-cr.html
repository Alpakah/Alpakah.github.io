                                Combat robotic events feature fights between
                                bots similar to the TV series "Battlebots&#8482;". Where as
                                the TV series fights at the heavyweight division listed at
                                250 lbs, the general combat robotics scene across the world
                                has a number of weight classes.
                                <br><br>
                                Sabertooth is the name for my Beetleweight (3 lb) Combat Robot,
                                which I built as a part of the Combat Robotics program within
                                the UCLA Student Chapter of the American Society of Mechanical
                                Engineers (ASME). I began building Sabertooth upon joining UCLA
                                as a freshman in the Fall of 2019, and continued to build it through
                                the Winter of 2020. However, in March of 2020, the Covid Pandemic
                                would halt all progress, a mere month before competition was supposed
                                to be held. For most in the program, the pandemic would shelf their
                                creations forever. But I was the only freshman in the program that 
                                would still stay in the organization to finally finish my work and
                                see my bot compete nearly three years later.

                            <p>
                                Since I completed the majority of Sabertooth as a freshman, the
                                bot features my earliest work as an engineer -- in fact, my first
                                work as an engineer.
                                <br><br>
                                This project was also my first exposure to so many different
                                skills: manual machining, 3D printing, soldering, and electrical
                                harnessing. I learned how to lathe and mill aluminum to 0.005"
                                accuracy, and also waterjet steel cutouts for the faces of the
                                aluminum weapon. I got to model and (albeit, rather crudely) estimate
                                the size and mass of electrical the electrical wiring and harnessing.                               
                                I even learned about the properties of thermal expansion, freezing
                                the aluminum rod that served as the axle for the rotating weapon in
                                order to reduce its cross sectional area so that it would fit into
                                bearings, pulleys, and the weapon itself, which would then expand as
                                it warms back up to room temperature, expanding back to its original
                                size and ensuring a interference fit.

                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Slap&Go is an Antwieght (1 lb) Combat Robot that I built for
                                a 10 week long class at UCLA. I wanted to have some fun with this
                                project and push the boundaries of the mass constraint with a shell
                                spinner, using the entire chassis as its weapon in an effort to put
                                as much mass behind the weapon as possible. I learned very
                                quickly that 1 lb is not a lot of mass for a combat robot, with the
                                electronics and wiring consuming 0.45 lbs alone. 
                                <br><br>
                                This project was an incredible exercise in mass reduction studies, as
                                the initial design measured out to be nearly 2 lbs. I was able to reduce
                                enough mass from the system to meet the 1 lb requirement; however,
                                this came at the cost of less material surrounding the bolted joints.

                    <p>
                        Below is a (rather fun) demonstration of Slap&Go's test run, where I replaced
                        its aluminum weapons with rubber hands... so it can "Slap" then "Go". Sadly its
                        fun design did not transalte to much success in the cage, as it lost in the first
                        round of competition. You can see how the first impact tears the weapon BLDC motor
                        off of its mounting fasteners, as the 3D printed PLA was too weak to support the impact.
                        The video for this is also shown below.
