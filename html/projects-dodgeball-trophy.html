                                In 2022, I served as the Social Director for the UCLA Student Chapter
                                of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), where I organized
                                a Dodgeball Tournament between all of the engineering organizations
                                at UCLA to duke it out to determine which organization reigned supreme.
                                After passing the torch to the following Social Directors, my hands were free
                                to create a permanent trophy to be presented to the winners of the tournament
                                and also to participate to try and win my own prize.
                                <br><br>
                                In homage to the 2004 film "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story", we handed out
                                the club's largest wrench to serve as the prize for the 2022 champions because
                                "If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball!" The following year in 2023,
                                I wanted to provide a trophy that an org would be proud to showcase in their
                                labspace and boast to the other campus organizations.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                    </div>

                    <div class="pictext-top">
                    
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                The trophy is comprised of two components, the base and the hand:
                                <br><br>
                                The base is composed of laser cut 3/16 inch plywood assembled into a
                                box shape. What is hidden on the interior is a series of 3D printed joints
                                that not only provide the wood more surface area to adhere onto, but also
                                a spot for threaded inserts to lie so that the front panel can easily be
                                removed via fasteners when it comes time to replace the panel for a new
                                year of competition. In regards to the front panel, it is a 1/8 thick piece
                                of acrylic that is laser cut and engraved with text.
                                <br><br>
                                For the hand, I found a free-use model of a hand in the shape of a
                                fist to use for the trophy. Then, to create space for the wrench to
                                sit in the fist, I hollowed out the center of the fist with the negative
                                space created by a representative wrench in the CAD. The knuckles were
                                then split apart from the palm and wrist to allow the wrench to go in
                                and can be re-attached with countersunk fasteners. And to prevent
                                the wrench from slipping out of the hand, a few layers of tape are
                                hidden in the palm of the hand to provide more friction and compression
                                onto the wrench from the clamping force of the fasteners in the knuckle.
                            </p>
