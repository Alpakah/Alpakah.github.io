                                My name is Alexander Pak, and I'm an engineer with an
                                Undergraduate Degree in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA
                                and currently working towards a Master's Degree in
                                Mechanical Engineering as well. I have a background in
                                Space Flight Systems and Mechatronics Design and am always
                                exploring new challenges! I played worldwide amateur golf for
                                15 years, to which I attribute a strong sense of self-accountability
                                and attention to detail.

                    <h2>My story</h2>

                    <div class="pictext-right">
                    
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Here's the long(er) story:
                                <br><br>
                                From ages 5 all the way through 18, I competed across the world playing
                                junior golf winning multiple world championships along the way and ranking
                                within the top 100 of all junior golfers at the age of 16 in 2017. I would
                                go on to leave my golf career upon graduating high school in 2019 and begin
                                my journey in Mechanical Engineering at UCLA.
                                <br><br>
                                Starting my Mechanical Engineering undergraduate degree in the Fall of 2019
                                would prove to shape the rest of my life in a multitude of ways -- namely,
                                the COVID pandemic. It hit real hard when I found out that I would be moving
                                all of my belongings out of the dormitories after only 6 months after my
                                college experience had begun. For the next two and a half years me and my
                                generation of student peers had to face the absence of physical interaction,
                                hands-on experiences, and accessibility to work.

                                But after a very delayed start to my aspirations as an engineer, I found
                                my footing after putting my head down and simply <i>doing</i>. Over the
                                span of a year I busted my ass to gain the technical and soft skills that
                                I was missing:
                                <br><br>
                                Over the course of an entire year, I completed 3 different robotic
                                assemblies as classwork, two of which were robotic manipulators. 
                                I worked a part time job at the UCLA Samueli Makerspace operating 3D
                                printers and other tools to enable thousands of UCLA engineers to complete
                                projects required for class, extracurricular clubs, or for personal use.
                                I was conducting research in the Biomechatronics Lab answering questions
                                regarding sensory robotics related to the human touch. I interned at 3
                                separate times, one of which was with Youtube Engineer JLaserVideo.
                                I led three college club organizations as the chair, including the UCLA
                                Student Chapter of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).
                                I met some incredible friends that I studied hard and played harder with.
                                All of this while not completing the accomplishment I am most proud of:
                                graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering Cum Laude.
                                <br><br>
                                Needless to say, it's been a whirlwind. My story has been incredible, and
                                it's not over yet.
