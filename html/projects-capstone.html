                                To graduate from the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering with a Bachelor's
                                Degree in Mechanical Engineering, every student must complete a capstone
                                course demonstrating all of their theoretical and technical knowledge by
                                building a functional project. I had the fortune to complete my capstone
                                under Dr. Dennis Hong, where students were able to pitch and pursue their
                                own design for a mechanical assembly to demonstrate engineering skills.
                                <br><br>
                                Together as a team of 7 students, I created "Manuel":
                                <br><br>
                                Manuel is a manually controlled robot that was designed to perform gestures
                                with its arm and spell in ASL with its hand. The arm was designed to mimic
                                the full 7 degrees of freedom that a human arm has. The hand and fingers
                                were designed to perform finger spelling, applying only enough degrees of
                                freedom to do so. These objectives were to be completed within 5 months
                                with a $600 budget plus part donations from the RoMeLa lab. Unfortunately,
                                these ambitious goals were not fully met. Manuel managed to perform exactly
                                one gesture with its arm and hand: flipping someone off. 
                            </p>
                        </div>

                    </div>

                    <div class="pictext-bot">
                    
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                I worked on the electrical system of Manuel, determining all the
                                required voltage and current for all of the electrical components
                                in the system and then choosing a sufficient power supply to provide
                                enough power to the entire system without providing too much voltage
                                or current to each individual component. I was able to re-purpose a
                                24V power supply from a broken 3D printer and step voltages/currents
                                down to the required amounts; however, that would end up being
                                extremely dangerous and produce high amounts of heat. I quickly learned
                                that sourcing old 5V and 3V power cords would suffice, and I could
                                splice and solder the wires to Dynamixel motors, Stepper motors,
                                Arduinos, and LED matrices.
                                <br><br>
                                I also 3D printed every single part of Manuel, with both FDM and SLA
                                printers. Thousands of hours using 3D printers came in handy, and this
                                task was no problem at all.
