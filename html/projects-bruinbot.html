                                X1 Robotics at UCLA is the college's premiere robotics organization.
                                At the beginning of every year, the team creates ideas and pitches them
                                to each other, ultimately voting on the single best idea to build over the
                                next two years with the first year dedicated to R&D and CAD and the second
                                year dedicated to manufacturing and assembly, integration, and testing (AI&T).
                                I entered the program as a Junior during the second year of this cycle, where
                                I manufactured certain components and redesigned others -- In this page I touch
                                on the subsystems I had direct involvement in re-designing and manufacturing.

                                BruinBot has a simple but powerful two-wheel tank drivetrain, powered by
                                two individual VEX Robotics CIM Motors with 30:1 gearboxes attached
                                to them (one on the left and one on the right) to ensure the drive
                                operates at a high enough torque to withstand the steep hills of the
                                UCLA campus. The back wheels feature standard wheels and the front
                                wheels are omni wheels to allow BruinBot to turn sharper. A chain
                                connects the motor to the wheels, with a tensioner that slides
                                horizontally as shown in the diagram above.

                    <h3>Head and Face</h3>

                    <div class="pictext-bot">
                    
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                BruinBot's head is driven by two stepper motors and serves as a
                                2 Degree of Freedom (DOF) robotic mechanism: the first motor drives
                                the head's rotation about the midline (vertical "z-axis"), and a
                                second motor sits within the head and drives its extension and
                                flexion (the "nodding" motion). If you look closely, the ears of
                                BruinBot also move even more in relation to the head, which is
                                driven by a 4 bar linkage within the head's frame.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="pictext-img-soft-inline">

                                BruinBot's face is powered by an LED Matrix behind "Black LED Acrylic"
                                so that the face panel appears opaque when unlit, but shows LED light
                                to pass through from behind. The facial expressions are controlled by
                                Arduino and cycle over time. The full desired function was to create
                                a user interface on the screen that would then prompt certain expressions
                                to appear, but the project did not reach that stage.

                    <h3>Arm and Payload</h3>

                    <div class="pictext-bot">
                    
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                My personal favorite function of BruinBot was its vending capabilities.
                                When I entered the project, the vending compartment had already been designed,
                                intended to be laser cut out of acrylic, but with no real means of assembly.
                                I redesigned the payload to use a "lock and key" design that would constrain
                                the assembly while allowing for easy assembly and disassembly. This component
                                also relied on precise tolerances for the interference fit between the lock
                                and keys to keep the components in place as the system vibrates.
                                <br><br>
                                BruinBot stores snacks in its belly and dispense them like a vending machine
                                onto a conveyor belt that would feed to the left hand, which would then
                                rotate upwards to hand it to you. The arm only contains 1 DOF and instead
                                features a four parallel 4 bar linkage within it so that the hand stays
                                completely parallel to the ground BruinBot is standing on -- a hand that I
                                designed myself to give BruinBot a bear-like quality without compromising
                                its function. I thoroughly enjoy working on both the technical engineering
                                and artistic design of projects
                                like these.

                                This project is by no means completely done by my own self -- the BruinBot
                                team worked incredibly hard to put this project together from scratch with
                                zero blueprint from prior years to build on like certain other programs. The
                                topics covered on this page are all components I redesigned or assembled, but
                                there are so many other components in this complex project that you can read
                                about in the full documentation below.
                                <br><br>
                                Ultimately, due to the program having a very delayed start in manufacturing
                                and assembly due to the Covid Pandemic, the project remains unfinished,
                                just short of being complete. At its current state, BruinBot has a fully
                                functioning head/face and is capable of driving around. Unfortunately, the
                                vending system and actuated arm were not fully operational by the conclusion
                                of the project, but it was incredibly fruitful to see most of the project
                                become realized from CAD space to assembly!
